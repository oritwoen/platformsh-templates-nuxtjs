This template builds a simple application using the NuxtJS web framework that can be used a starting point.

NuxtJS is an open-source web framework based on Vue.js.

## Features

* Node.js 18
* Automatic TLS certificates
* yarn-based build

## Customizations

The following files and additions make the framework work on Platform.sh, modified from the [`npx nuxi init <app>`](https://nuxt.new/) command for Nuxt v3.
If using this project as a reference for your own existing project, replicate the changes below to your project.

* The `.platform.app.yaml`, `.platform/services.yaml`, and `.platform/routes.yaml` files have been added. These provide Platform.sh-specific configuration and are present in all projects on Platform.sh. You may customize them as you see fit.
